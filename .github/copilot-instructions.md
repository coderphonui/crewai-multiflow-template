## Purpose

This project is a multi-flow CrewAI-based application.

## Quick start (commands)

- Python: required 3.10 ≤ py < 3.13 (see `pyproject.toml`).
- Install uv and project deps: `pip install uv` then (optional) `crewai install`.
- Install required packages: `pip install python-dotenv` and `pip install "crewai[tools]>=0.114.0,<1.0.0"`
- Set LLM API key: add `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key` to a `.env` file in the project root.
- Run flows from the repo root: `python run_flow.py <flow_name> [command]`
  - Example: `python run_flow.py poem_flow` or `python run_flow.py poem_flow kickoff`
  - The runner automatically loads `.env` and sets up Python paths

## Big-picture architecture

- This repo is a crewAI-based multi-agent project with support for multiple flows. The runtime is organized around:
  - Flows: each flow lives in `src/flows/<flow_name>/` (e.g., `src/flows/poem_flow/main.py` defines `PoemFlow`)
  - Crews: each flow has its own crews in `src/flows/<flow_name>/crews/` (e.g., `poem_crew.py` defines `PoemCrew` using `@CrewBase`)
  - Agents & Tasks: configured by YAML under each crew's `config/` directory (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`)
  - Tools: shared tools live under `src/interview_assistant/tools/` (see `custom_tool.py`)
  - Runner: `run_flow.py` at project root handles Python path setup and flow execution

- Data flow example: `PoemFlow.generate_poem` calls
  `PoemCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={"sentence_count": ...})` and stores the returned `result.raw` into `poem.txt`.

## Project-specific conventions and patterns

- YAML-driven agent/task configuration: agent and task behavior (role, goal, llm, expected_output) comes from YAML keys referenced by `agents_config` and `tasks_config`.
  - Example: `agents_config = "config/agents.yaml"` then `Agent(config=self.agents_config["poem_writer"])`.
- Decorator wiring: use `@agent`, `@task`, and `@crew` on methods inside `@CrewBase` classes to auto-create runtime objects.
- Crew process default: `Process.sequential` is used in the example crew—expect synchronous task ordering unless changed.
- Tools implement `crewai.tools.BaseTool` with a Pydantic `args_schema` (see `MyCustomTool` in `tools/custom_tool.py`).

## Integration points & external dependencies

- Primary runtime: `crewai` package (Flow, Crew, Agent, Task, Process, tools). Look at imports in `main.py` and `poem_crew.py`.
- LLM provider: YAML may specify `llm: gemini/gemini-2.5-flash` — ensure credentials (GEMINI_API_KEY) and provider-specific config are present when running.

## Examples the assistant may produce or modify

- To add a new flow: create directory `src/flows/<new_flow_name>/` with `main.py`, crews, and config following the `poem_flow` pattern
- To add an agent that uses a tool: add tool class in `src/interview_assistant/tools/`, update the flow's `agents.yaml`, and add an `@agent` factory method in the crew class
- To change outputs: modify the flow's save method (e.g., `PoemFlow.save_poem` writes `poem.txt` at repo root)

## Files worth checking when making edits

- `run_flow.py` — Flow runner with Python path setup and `.env` loading for executing flows from project root
- `src/flows/<flow_name>/main.py` — Flow orchestrator and entry points (`kickoff`, `plot`)
- `src/flows/<flow_name>/crews/<crew_name>/<crew_name>.py` — crew declaration, agent/task factories
- `src/flows/<flow_name>/crews/<crew_name>/config/agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` — authoritative agent/task definitions
- `src/interview_assistant/tools/` — shared custom tools implementation and schemas
- `.env` — environment variables (API keys) loaded automatically by `run_flow.py`
- `poem.txt` — example runtime artifact generated by flows

## Constraints & non-obvious details

- Many runtime objects are created dynamically by decorators and YAML lookups. When editing, change both code and YAML consistently.
- `python run_flow.py <flow_name>` is the recommended entry point for running flows from the project root
- The `run_flow.py` script automatically loads `.env` file and sets up Python paths
- Each flow is self-contained in `src/flows/<flow_name>/` with its own crews and configuration
- API keys should be stored in `.env` file at project root (not committed to git)

## Merge guidance (if updating this file)

- Preserve the Quick start commands and any project-specific environment hints (Python range, GEMINI_API_KEY).
- Keep concrete file references; avoid adding generic policy or style rules that aren't discoverable in code.
